# AnsibleAutomationAPI

During my software engineering internship within Digital Technology Operations - Infrastructure Automation at Ameren, 
- Created an Ansible API utilizing Flask to run Ansible playbooks from a VRA endpoint.
â€” Encrypted credentials at rest, ran multiple Ansible playbooks to deploy automation tasks simultaneously, created different paths for playbooks to be run on, logged API call information, and returned playbook output to the end-user.
